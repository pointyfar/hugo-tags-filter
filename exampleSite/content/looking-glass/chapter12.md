‘Your majesty shouldn’t purr so loud,’ Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and
addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. ‘You
woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you’ve been along with me,
Kitty--all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?’

It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the
remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. ‘If they would
only purr for “yes” and mew for “no,” or any rule of that sort,’ she had
said, ‘so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN you talk
with a person if they always say the same thing?’

On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant ‘yes’ or ‘no.’

So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. ‘Now, Kitty!’ she cried,
clapping her hands triumphantly. ‘Confess that was what you turned
into!’

(‘But it wouldn’t look at it,’ she said, when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister: ‘it turned away its head, and pretended
not to see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself, so I think it
MUST have been the Red Queen.’)

‘Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!’ Alice cried with a merry laugh.
‘And curtsey while you’re thinking what to--what to purr. It saves time,
remember!’ And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, ‘just in
honour of having been a Red Queen.’

‘Snowdrop, my pet!’ she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White
Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, ‘when WILL
Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream--Dinah! do you know that you’re
scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it’s most disrespectful of you!

‘And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder?’ she prattled on, as she settled
comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand,
to watch the kittens. ‘Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty? I
THINK you did--however, you’d better not mention it to your friends just
yet, for I’m not sure.

‘By the way, Kitty, if only you’d been really with me in my dream, there
was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity of poetry
said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real
treat. All the time you’re eating your breakfast, I’ll repeat “The
Walrus and the Carpenter” to you; and then you can make believe it’s
oysters, dear!

‘Now, Kitty, let’s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a
serious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your paw
like that--as if Dinah hadn’t washed you this morning! You see, Kitty,
it MUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream,
of course--but then I was part of his dream, too! WAS it the Red King,
Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--Oh, Kitty, DO
help to settle it! I’m sure your paw can wait!’ But the provoking kitten
only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn’t heard the question.

Which do YOU think it was?


              ----


         A boat beneath a sunny sky,
         Lingering onward dreamily
         In an evening of July--

         Children three that nestle near,
         Eager eye and willing ear,
         Pleased a simple tale to hear--

         Long has paled that sunny sky:
         Echoes fade and memories die.
         Autumn frosts have slain July.

         Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
         Alice moving under skies
         Never seen by waking eyes.

         Children yet, the tale to hear,
         Eager eye and willing ear,
         Lovingly shall nestle near.

         In a Wonderland they lie,
         Dreaming as the days go by,
         Dreaming as the summers die:

         Ever drifting down the stream--
         Lingering in the golden gleam--
         Life, what is it but a dream?


              THE END
